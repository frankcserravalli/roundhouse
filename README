The Roundhouse gem is a library of business models and logic that sits on top of the Rails framework. I took inspiration for the name from 1800s era railroading:

"A roundhouse is a building used by railroads for servicing locomotives. Roundhouses are large, circular or semicircular structures that were traditionally located surrounding or adjacent to turntables. The defining feature of the traditional roundhouse was the turntable, which facilitates access when the building is used for repair facilities or for storage of steam locomotives.

Early steam locomotives normally travelled forwards only; although reverse operations capabilities were soon built into locomotive mechanisms, the controls were normally optimized for forward travel, and the locomotives often could not operate as well in reverse. Some passenger cars, such as observation cars, were also designed as late as the 1960s for operations in a particular direction. A turntable allowed a locomotive or other rolling stock to be turned around for the return journey." See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhouse

Our target platform is Rails 3.0 or greater and Ruby 1.8.7 or greater. Your mileage on lesser versions will vary.

We are focused on the business models and logic that re-occur between projects. So, you will not find much in the way of controllers or views here. It is up to you to incorporate the models into the user interface that makes the most sense for your project.

Roundhouse is made-up of separate modules under the Roundhouse namespace. Each of those modules is contained in a separate sub-directory of this project.

Roundhouse::Country is a collection of all the International Country Codes and Names including Subdivisions. The names are localized using I18n, so your select tags and navigation links will 'just work'. See country/readme for more information.
